## Peering into Images

A very simple challenge where we're given an image and need to get a flag out of it.
First instinct guides us to simply head over to terminal and run the `strings` command on the image to get its bytes. 

Running `strings st.jpeg` , the flag is handed to us with no effort : `flag:Nycpicdeer`
